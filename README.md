# Data Structures and Algorithms

This project walks through the implementation of all the basic concepts in DSA from Linked lists through to graphs.

## Sections and Directories

1. Linked list - 0-ds_lnklst
2. doubly linked list - 1-ds_dblnklst

## Installation 

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k-ojo/DSA.git
```
2. Change directory to the subject you are interested in. For example in you are interested in linked list use this command.

```bash
cd 0-ds_lnklst
```

3. 
```bash
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
cmake --build .
.\app
```
